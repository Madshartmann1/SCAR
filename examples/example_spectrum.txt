# Example mutation spectrum file (proportions/ratios)
# Format: from_base  to_base  proportion
# All 12 substitutions must be specified
# Values will be normalized to sum to 1.0 automatically
# 
# This example represents a typical mammalian mutation spectrum
# with Ts/Tv ratio of ~2.0 and some CpG effect (C->T elevated)

# Transitions (typically ~2/3 of all mutations)
A   G   0.20
G   A   0.20
C   T   0.25    # Elevated due to CpG deamination
T   C   0.15

# Transversions (typically ~1/3 of all mutations)
A   C   0.05
A   T   0.05
C   A   0.02
C   G   0.02
G   C   0.02
G   T   0.02
T   A   0.01
T   G   0.01

# Note: These will be normalized, so the actual values don't need to sum to 1
# What matters is the relative proportions
# In this example, C->T is most common (CpG effect), followed by A->G and G->A
